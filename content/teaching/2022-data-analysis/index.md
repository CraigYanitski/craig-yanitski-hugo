## Data Analysis in Physics and Astronomy

> Location: I. Physikalishes Institut, Universität zu Köln
> 
> Level: Master's

The course was given by Priv. Doz. Dr. Markus Röllig, and I was a tutor along with Dr. Christof Buchbender. 
I prepared and assisted in the completion of weekly assignments. 
One note-worthy aspect of this is that Dr. Buchbender setup a jupyterhub server to accommodate the 
virtual nature of the course. 
It was very useful for distributing and assisting with code.
