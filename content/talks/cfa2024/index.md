This was an invited talk for the Radio Millimeter Submillimeter group
during my research visit.
I presented on my PhD project within a larger context and a summary of ongoing work.

> **Location:** room M-340 in 160 Concord Avenue, Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA
> 
> **Title:** Modelling the emission from the inhomogeneous ISM: a simulation of fractal PDRs
> 
> **Abstract:** The interstellar medium has a complex structure, and this is complicated even 
> further by turbulent motions in dynamic environments. This leads to difficulty when trying to 
> interpret ISM observations, particularly for observations containing many different environments. 
> In my talk I will give an overview of some efforts in interpreting observations of the inhomogeneous 
> ISM, how this has affected the way we model it, and my efforts in creating synthetic observations 
> of the inhomogeneous ISM.
