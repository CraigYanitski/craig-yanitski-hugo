## Asteroseismology: the music of the stars

This was a public presentation (in English) for the Arnhem chapter of the 
Koninklijke Nederlandse Vereniging voor Weer- en Sterrenkunde. 
I gave an introduction to the wonderful science of asteroseismology, 
motivated by a course I had recently taken in Nijmegen.

> **Location:** Zalencentrum Parkstraete, Velp, Netherlands
> 
> **Abstract:** In asteroseismology, astronomers use variations in light curves of stars to
> measure their pulsations and learn information on what occurs inside them. This wonderful field of
> study uses precise data from space missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS to measure this
> variability. I will provide an intuitive introduction to this topic and briefly summarize recent and
> future research.
