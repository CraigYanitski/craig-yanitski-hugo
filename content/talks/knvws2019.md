## Asteroseismology: the music of the stars

> Location: Zalencentrum Parkstraete

This was a public presentation (in English) for the Arnhem chapter of the 
Koninklijke Nederlandse Vereniging voor Weer- en Sterrenkunde. 
I gave an introduction to the wonderful science of asteroseismology, 
motivated by a course I had recently taken in Nijmegen.
