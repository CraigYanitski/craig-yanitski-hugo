Welcome to my website!
I am a computational astrophysicist with ~12 years' experience in programming.
I have the most experience with an interpreted language like python, though I do prefer 
statically typed languages like C++, Rust, and Go.
I also enjoy working from the command line, so I will probably make some projects for bash and vim soon.

My coding summary for those interested,

> - coding in Python for 12 years
> - coding in C++ for 7 years
> - working with relational DBs in SQL for 5 years
> - working in Go and Rust in the past months

and my work for the science people,

> - compute on emission from irradiated gas (PDRs)
> - model the clumpy ISM using a statistical approach (combinatorics)
> - perform ray tracing on the resulting 3D model
